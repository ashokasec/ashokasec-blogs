# Why JWE Outperforms JWT in Client-Side Security?

Here's something better than **JWT** that most Devs are unaware of and risking their user's confidential data on client-side.

## Introduction to JOSE

There's an NPM package called <AshLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose" target="_blank">JOSE</AshLink> (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) that handle JWT and more, including

- JSON Web Token (**JWT**)
- JSON Web Signatures (**JWS**),
- JSON Web Encryption (**JWE**),
- JSON Web Key Set (**JWKS**)

and more...

IRL, you'll be mostly working with **JWTs** and **JWEs** and am also talking about these 2 here.

If you're familiar with **JWT**, you know this sends a token to client side, since it's only **encoded** with a secret key or signature, the data isn't protected and can still be easily read without an encryption key.

### Example

If you use **JWT**, this data will give...

```json
{
  "patientId": "12345",
  "name": "ashokasec",
  "medicalRecord": "ConfidentialData123"
}
```

output like this...

```plaintext
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJwYXRpZW50SWQiOiIxMjM0NSIsIm5hbWUiOiJhc2hva2FzZWMiLCJtZWRpY2FsUmVjb3JkIjoiQ29uZmlkZW50aWFsRGF0YTEyMyJ9._qEpfAB2p5l8NjJ20Ys_-D2wrdQvzWDJqd-X0Qezj_Q
```

Even though the token is encoded with a secret key, the encoded information is still visible to the client side, which is why it is advised not to include any secrets or confidential data on the client side.

In contrast, if you use JWE, it will give you something similar to a JWT token but with 5 parts (the header - the encrypted key - the initialization vector (IV) - the ciphertext - the auth tag).

The JWE token is encrypted, so it cannot be decrypted without the encryption key.

## High Level Conclusion

JWE is used where the transmission of data should be very confidential. The ideal situation for using JWE is, for example, in a healthcare app where you need to send sensitive patient.

## When to use JWE?

JWE is used where the transmission of data should be very confidential. The ideal situation for using JWE is, for example, in a healthcare app where you need to send sensitive patient.

- Using JWT alone can be risky because if the token is intercepted, the sensitive information could be exposed, as JWTs are only encoded and not encrypted.
- To keep the data secure, JWE is a better choice. JWE encrypts the token, so even if intercepted, the sensitive data remains protected and confidential. This makes JWE the ideal option for securely transmitting sensitive information.
